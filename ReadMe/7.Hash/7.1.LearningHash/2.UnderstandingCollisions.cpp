/*
	2.Understanding Collisions
	Write a program to implement basic hashing using the hash function 
	( h(k) = k \mod 5 ), insert the keys 5, 10, 15 into an array of size 5. 
	Observe what happens when multiple keys hash to the same index and explain 
	the concept of collisions.
*/

/*
	what is hash function?

	Hash function is basically the mapping procedure of values to Hash data structure.
	
	This process known as hashing. and it is usually done by using hash functions.

	In our previous code we mapped 
	a to 0
	b to 1
	c to 3
	......
	......
	......
	z to 25

	using hashing
