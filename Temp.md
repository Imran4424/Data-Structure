### Hash Data Structure Problems

1. **Hashing with Array Index:**

   - Write a program to implement basic hashing by directly mapping keys to array indices using a simple hash function \( h(k) = k \). Store the keys in an array and display the resulting array. Example: Counting the letter count of a string

2. **Handling Collisions with Linear Probing:**

   - Write a program to implement a hash table using linear probing to resolve collisions. Use the hash function \( h(k) = k \mod n \), where \( n \) is the size of the array. Insert a set of keys into the hash table and demonstrate how collisions are resolved using linear probing.

3. **Handling Collisions with Quadratic Probing:**

   - Write a program to implement a hash table using quadratic probing for collision resolution. Use the probing sequence \( h(k, i) = (h(k) + i^2) \mod n \). Insert keys into the hash table and show how quadratic probing handles collisions.

4. **Understanding and Implementing Hash Functions:**

   - Explain why the choice of a hash function is crucial in a hash table. Provide examples of good and poor hash functions. Then, write a program to implement a hash function that distributes keys uniformly across the hash table.

5. **Bucket Hashing Using a 2D Array:**

   - Write a program to implement bucket hashing using a 2D array (an array of arrays). Use a hash function to assign keys to buckets (rows of the 2D array) and store colliding keys in the same bucket. Display the contents of each bucket.

6. **Hashing with Linked Lists (Chaining):**

   - Write a program to implement a hash table where each array index contains a linked list to handle collisions (chaining). Use a hash function to insert keys into the hash table and demonstrate how the linked lists store colliding keys.

7. **Implementing Chaining to Resolve Collisions:**

   - Write a program to implement chaining in a hash table to resolve collisions. Insert a set of keys into the hash table, where each collision results in a new node being added to a linked list at that index. Display the hash table with the linked lists.

8. **Search Operation in a Hash Table with Chaining:**

   - Write a program to search for a specific key in a hash table that uses chaining. Implement the search function that traverses the linked list at the hashed index to find the key.

9. **Deletion in a Hash Table with Chaining:**

   - Write a program to delete a specific key from a hash table that uses chaining. Implement the deletion function that removes the key from the linked list at the hashed index.

10. **Rehashing in Hash Tables:**

    - Write a program to implement rehashing in a hash table when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold. Show how to rehash the existing keys into a larger hash table with a new hash function.

11. **Double Hashing for Collision Resolution:**

    - Write a program to implement a hash table using double hashing for collision resolution. Use two hash functions \( h_1(k) = k \mod n \) and \( h_2(k) = 1 + (k \mod (n-1)) \). Insert keys into the hash table and demonstrate how double hashing resolves collisions.

12. **Implementing a Custom Hash Function:**

    - Write a program to implement a custom hash function for string keys. The function should convert a string into an integer hash value that is uniformly distributed across the hash table indices.

13. **Performance Analysis of Hash Tables:**

    - Analyze the time complexity of various operations (insertion, search, deletion) in a hash table using different collision resolution methods (linear probing, quadratic probing, chaining). Write a report summarizing your findings.

14. **Comparing Collision Resolution Strategies:**

    - Write programs to implement hash tables using linear probing, quadratic probing, and chaining. Insert the same set of keys into each hash table and compare their performance in terms of collisions, search time, and load factors.

15. **Implementing Open Addressing Techniques:**

    - Write a program to implement a hash table using open addressing techniques (linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing). Demonstrate how each technique handles collisions and analyze their efficiency.

16. **Designing a Hash Table for a Real-world Application:**

    - Design and implement a hash table for a real-world application, such as a phonebook or dictionary. Choose an appropriate hash function and collision resolution method. Ensure efficient insertion, search, and deletion operations.

17. **Implementing a Hash Map (Associative Array):**

    - Write a program to implement a hash map that associates keys with values. Use a hash table with chaining to handle collisions. Implement functions to insert, search, and delete key-value pairs.

18. **Handling Deletions in Open Addressing:**

    - Write a program to correctly handle deletions in a hash table that uses open addressing (e.g., linear probing). Implement lazy deletion or special markers to maintain the integrity of the probing sequence.

19. **Dynamic Resizing of a Hash Table:**

    - Write a program to implement a hash table that dynamically resizes (expands or contracts) based on the load factor. Ensure that all elements are rehashed correctly after resizing.

20. **Hashing and Load Factors:**

    - Experiment with different load factors in a hash table using chaining and open addressing. Write a report on how the load factor affects the performance of the hash table operations.
