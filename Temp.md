<!-- Binary Search Tree (BST) -->

## 10. Binary Search Tree (BST)

1. **Basic Binary Search Tree Creation:**

   - **Problem:** Write a program to create a binary search tree with the following values: `50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80`. Display the structure of the tree.

2. **Insert a Node in a Binary Search Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write a program to insert a node into a binary search tree. Insert the value `65` into the binary search tree created in the previous problem.

3. **Search for a Node in a Binary Search Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write a function to search for a node with a specific value in a binary search tree. Use the tree created in the first problem to search for the value `40`.

4. **Delete a Node from a Binary Search Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write a function to delete a node from a binary search tree. Use the tree from the previous problem and delete the node with the value `70`.

5. **Find the Minimum and Maximum in a Binary Search Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write functions to find the minimum and maximum values in a binary search tree. Use the BST from the previous problems to find both.

6. **Find the Height of a Binary Search Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write a function to find the height of a binary search tree. Use the BST created earlier and determine its height.

7. **Inorder Successor in a Binary Search Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write a function to find the inorder successor of a given node in a binary search tree. Use the tree created earlier and find the inorder successor of node `60`.

8. **Check if a Tree is a Binary Search Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write a function to check if a given binary tree is a binary search tree. Create a sample tree and test this function.

9. **Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in a Binary Search Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write a function to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary search tree. Use the tree from earlier problems to find the LCA of nodes `20` and `40`.

10. **Find the Kth Smallest Element in a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to find the k-th smallest element in a binary search tree. Use the tree created earlier and find the 3rd smallest element.

11. **Check if a Binary Search Tree is Balanced:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to check if a binary search tree is balanced. A balanced tree is one where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most `1`. Use the tree from the previous problems.

12. **Convert a Binary Search Tree to a Doubly Linked List:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to convert a binary search tree into a doubly linked list using in-order traversal. Display the resulting linked list.

13. **Find the Closest Value to a Given Target in a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to find the value in a binary search tree that is closest to a given target value. Use the tree created earlier and find the closest value to `55`.

14. **Find the Mode (Most Frequent Element) in a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to find the mode (the value that appears most frequently) in a binary search tree. Create a BST with duplicate values and find the mode.

15. **Convert a Binary Search Tree to a Balanced BST:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to convert an unbalanced binary search tree into a balanced binary search tree. Use the tree created earlier and convert it into a balanced BST.

16. **Inorder Predecessor in a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to find the inorder predecessor of a given node in a binary search tree. Use the tree created earlier and find the inorder predecessor of node `40`.

17. **Merge Two Binary Search Trees:**

    - **Problem:** Write a program to merge two binary search trees into one binary search tree. Create two sample BSTs and merge them.

18. **Print All Elements in a Given Range in a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to print all elements in a binary search tree that lie within a given range `[low, high]`. Use the tree created earlier to print elements within the range `[30, 70]`.

19. **Find the Floor and Ceiling of a Value in a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to find the floor (largest value smaller than or equal to the target) and ceiling (smallest value larger than or equal to the target) of a given value in a binary search tree. Use the tree created earlier to find the floor and ceiling of `65`.

20. **Check if Two Binary Search Trees are Identical:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to check if two binary search trees are identical in terms of structure and node values. Create two identical trees and one different tree to test your function.

21. **Convert a Sorted Array to a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to convert a sorted array into a balanced binary search tree. Use the sorted array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]` and create a balanced BST.

22. **Find the Diameter of a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to calculate the diameter (the longest path between two leaf nodes) of a binary search tree. Use the tree from earlier problems and calculate its diameter.

23. **Find All Nodes at a Given Distance from a Node in a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to find all nodes that are at a distance `k` from a given node in a binary search tree. Use the tree created earlier and find nodes at distance `2` from node `30`.

24. **Print Nodes at K Distance from the Root in a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to print all nodes at a distance `k` from the root of a binary search tree. Use the tree created earlier and print nodes at distance `2`.

25. **Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Search Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write functions to serialize a binary search tree (convert it into a string) and deserialize the string back into the original tree. Test both functions to ensure they are working correctly.

26. **Build a BST to hold only unique elements (Set):**

    - **Problem:** Write a program to create Binary Search Tree(BST) to hold unique elements like Set.
