3. **Insert a Node in a Binary Tree:**

   - **Problem:** Write a program to insert a node into a binary tree at the first available position (level order insertion). Insert the value `60` into the binary tree created in the first problem.

4. **Find the Height of a Binary Tree:**

9. **Check if Two Trees are Identical:**

   - **Problem:** Write a function to check if two binary trees are identical in terms of structure and node values. Create two identical trees and one different tree to test your function.

10. **Find the Depth of a Specific Node:**

11. **Mirror a Binary Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to convert a binary tree into its mirror image. Apply this function to the tree from earlier problems and display the mirrored structure.

12. **Check if a Binary Tree is Balanced:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. A balanced tree is one in which the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most `1`.

13. **Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA):**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree. Use the tree from previous problems to find the LCA of nodes `20` and `40`.

14. **Print All Paths from Root to Leaf:**

    - **Problem:** Write a program to print all the paths from the root node to the leaf nodes of a binary tree. Use the tree from earlier problems to list all such paths.

15. **Check if a Binary Tree is Symmetric:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to check if a binary tree is symmetric around its center (i.e., it is a mirror of itself). Test your function with both symmetric and asymmetric trees.

16. **Convert a Binary Tree to a Doubly Linked List:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to convert a binary tree into a doubly linked list using in-order traversal. Display the resulting doubly linked list.

17. **Find the Diameter of a Binary Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to determine the diameter of a binary tree (the longest path between two leaf nodes). Use the tree from earlier problems and calculate its diameter.

18. **Print Nodes at K Distance from the Root:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to print all nodes at a distance `k` from the root of a binary tree. Use the tree created earlier and print nodes at distance `2`.

19. **Zigzag (Spiral) Level Order Traversal:**

    - **Problem:** Write a program to perform a zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree. Alternate the traversal direction for each level of the tree.

20. **Convert a Binary Tree to its Sum Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to convert a binary tree into its sum tree, where each node contains the sum of the values of its left and right subtrees. Use the original tree and display the new tree structure.

21. **Check if a Binary Tree is a Subtree of Another Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to check if a given binary tree is a subtree of another binary tree. Create a main tree and a subtree to test this function.

22. **Boundary Traversal of a Binary Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a program to perform the boundary traversal of a binary tree. Print the boundary nodes in anti-clockwise direction starting from the root.

23. **Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to serialize a binary tree (convert it into a string) and another function to deserialize the string back into the original binary tree. Test both functions to ensure they are working correctly.

24. **Find All Nodes at Distance K from a Given Node:**

    - **Problem:** Write a function to find all nodes that are at distance `k` from a given node in a binary tree. Use the tree from earlier problems and find nodes at distance `2` from node `20`.

25. **Flatten a Binary Tree to a Linked List:**
    - **Problem:** Write a function to flatten a binary tree to a linked list in-place following preorder traversal. Use the tree from earlier problems and display the linked list.
